# My Interests

Over the past 20 years of my life I've picked up on many sports like golf, football, and lacrosse throughout highschool. After
highschool, I did'nt play play much of any sport but enjoyed sill watching them. Every since highschool I've been super big on
travel, computers, movies, and a little bit of coding.

I've been to 3 festicals and over 150 concerts in my life! with my favorite festival being [lollapalooza](https://lollastockholm.com/)
in *Stockholm, Swedan!*

### Coding 

I've been coding for a little over a year now, mostly in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and I've really enjoyed most of it overall!
From complicated problems to easy ones like: 

```
print("my name is Jackon Orr.")
print("I am from columbia.")
```
