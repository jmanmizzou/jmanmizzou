# My Work Experience

I've been working since I was 12 starting as member on a junior advisory board for a family bank and I am still a member 
of the board helping make decisions to help better the bank. Ever since I was 12, I have worked jobs washing cars to joining
the militray. But with every new job I've taken on I feel it has only helped me grow as a person.

### Most Recent Job

I have been working for the **Missouri Army National Gaurd** for a little over 3 years now as a 25U *(Signal Support
Specialist).*

I feel that the Army has done these things for me:

- Helped me see the world in a different light 
- grow as a person physically and mentally 
- Help me pay for college

### Future Job Hopes 

I hope to get a Job after I finish college using [python](https://www.python.org/) or [Java](9https://www.java.com/en/).

For an example of python, please [click here](AboutMe.md).

An example of Java is:

```
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}

```

This will print, **Hello, World!**
